# FlashCards 

## Abstract 
This is an application that runs through the command line interface and simulates flashcards. Users are presented with a deck of 30 different questions about array prototype methods, they can take guesses and see a final score at the end of the round. 

The project was written by Claire Fields- a Mod 2 Front End Engineering student at the Turing School of Software and Design. The core learning goal of the project was to practice test driven development (TDD) using mocha, chai, and a tiny bit of sinon. The project language is JavaScript.

## Working application

Users are prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback:

At the end of the deck of cards, users will be provided with a final score:
